To install Seurat, [R](https://www.r-project.org/) version 4.0 or greater is required. We also recommend installing [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/).

# ![Seurat v5:](../output/images/SeuratV5.png){#id .class width=60 height=60} Seurat 5: Install from CRAN 
 
Seurat is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Seurat) for all platforms. To install, run: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Enter commands in R (or R studio, if installed)
install.packages('Seurat')
library(Seurat)
```

Seurat does not require, but makes use of, packages developed by other labs that can substantially enhance speed and performance. These include [presto](https://github.com/immunogenomics/presto) (Korunsky/Raychaudhari labs), [BPCells](https://github.com/bnprks/BPCells) (Greenleaf Lab), and [glmGamPoi](https://github.com/const-ae/glmGamPoi) (Huber Lab). We recommend users install these along with users:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
setRepositories(ind = 1:3, addURLs = c('https://satijalab.r-universe.dev', 'https://bnprks.r-universe.dev/'))
install.packages(c("BPCells", "presto", "glmGamPoi"))
```

We also recommend installing these additional packages, which are used in our vignettes, and enhance the functionality of Seurat:

* [Signac](https://github.com/stuart-lab/signac): analysis of single-cell chromatin data
* [SeuratData](https://github.com/satijalab/seurat-data): automatically load datasets pre-packaged as Seurat objects
* [Azimuth](https://github.com/satijalab/azimuth): local annotation of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq queries across multiple organs and tissues
* [SeuratWrappers](https://github.com/satijalab/seurat-wrappers): enables use of additional integration and differential expression methods

```{r additional, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('Signac')
remotes::install_github("satijalab/seurat-data", quiet = TRUE)
remotes::install_github("satijalab/azimuth", quiet = TRUE)
remotes::install_github("satijalab/seurat-wrappers", quiet = TRUE)
```

For versions of Seurat older than those not hosted on CRAN (versions 1.3.0 and 1.4.0), please download the packaged source code from our [releases page](https://github.com/satijalab/seurat/releases) and [install from the tarball](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4739837/how-do-i-install-an-r-package-from-the-source-tarball-on-windows).
